                  <strong>Answer: sessionStorage is similar to localStorage; </strong>
                  <p>the difference is that while data in localStorage doesn't expire, data in sessionStorage is cleared when the page session ends. </p>
                    <p><strong>in session storage</strong> data is deleted when the browser is closed and data is not available for future sessions.</p>
                    <p><strong>in local storage,</strong> data is not deleted when the browser is closed and data is available for future sessions</p>
                   Whenever a document is loaded in a particular tab in the browser, a unique page session gets created and assigned to that particular tab.

                  <strong>This is the second item's accordion body.</strong> It is hidden by default, until the collapse plugin adds the appropriate classes that we use to style each element. These classes control the overall appearance, as well as the showing and hiding via CSS transitions. You can modify any of this with custom CSS or overriding our default variables. It's also worth noting that just about any HTML can go within the <code>.accordion-body</code>, though the transition does limit overflow.
